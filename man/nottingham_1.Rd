\description{
\code{nottingham_1} provides the primary colour and five corresponding tints   
of the \href{https://www.nottingham.ac.uk}{University of Nottingham}, England/UK.
}
\details{
\code{Nottingham blue} is the key colour for the university 
and should feature on all assets. 
It is defined as \code{CMYK: 100, 79, 47, 56}, \code{PMS: 539 C}, 
\code{RGB: R16, G38, B59}, or \code{HEX: "#10263B"}.


The deep, rich colour helps the university to be recognisable and 
itâ€™s also associated with trust and respect. 
The colour "black" is no longer part of the Nottingham palette and 
\code{Nottingham blue} should be used as a replacement (this includes body copy).

There are five approved tints that can also be used for variety and to assist legibility. 
HEX codes have been provided for each tint, and these should be used when creating digital artwork, 
rather than using opacity.

Users must choose the correct colour output (RGB for digital and CMYK for print) 
for the asset and its usage.

\code{nottingham_1} uses the HEX color definitions.
