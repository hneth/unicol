\code{auckland_1} provides the university web colour styles  
of the \href{https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html}{University of Auckland}, New Zealand.
}
\details{
The spectrum provides each faculty with the opportunity to have a unique visual identity. 
It has been specifically designed to be web-friendly and match the facultyâ€™s printed collateral  
(e.g., prospectuses).

These colour styles are used as the theme of the faculty site and 
also applies to the link and button styles / gradients.

The documented HEX values should be used for all screen colour representations, 
rather than RGB conversions of the specified print colours.

In addition to these specifications, the website uses a range of 
colours within the spectrum of the colour style.

A faculty is able to choose between using the 
University web colour range (see \code{\link{auckland_1}}) 
or their specific faculty style.
