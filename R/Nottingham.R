# 1: Primary colours ----

# Primary colour

# Nottingham blue is the key colour for the university and should feature on all assets. 
# The deep, rich colour helps the university to be recognisable and 
# it’s also associated with trust and respect.

# Black is no longer part of the Nottingham palette and 
# Nottingham blue should be used as a replacement (this includes body copy).

# There are five approved tints that can also be used for variety and to assist legibility. 
# HEX codes have been provided for each tint, and these should be used when creating digital artwork, 
# rather than using opacity.

# You must ensure you use the correct colour output (RGB for digital and CMYK for print) 
# for the asset and its usage.

# Nottingham blue:
#  CMYK: 100, 79, 47, 56
#  RGB: R16, G38, B59
#  HEX: "#10263B"
#  PMS: 539 C
# 
# 5 tints:

#   60%: "#707D89"

# 2: Supporting colours ----

# Supporting palette
#    
# Our supporting colours are accents. 
# They add warmth and vibrancy and can elevate designs. 
# Inspired by the University of Nottingham campus, key brand messages and the city of Nottingham, 
# nine colours build up the palette to complement our primary Nottingham Blue.
#    
# The palette should be used sparingly, 
# with a maximum of two supporting colours in any one asset.
#    
# Where colour is used within an asset, Nottingham Blue needs to be visually dominant and 
# the supporting palette should be less than half of the make-up of colour within the asset.
#    
# Supporting colours can and should be used for campaigns and initiatives, 
# to help audience recognition and aid navigation.
#    
# You must ensure you use the correct colour output for the asset and its usage 
# (RGB for digital and CMYK for print), as values have been created to keep the most vibrancy in print and the best colour representation across digital channels.
#    
# Each colour has five tints that can also be used for variety and to assist legibility. HEX codes have been provided for each tint, 
# and these should be used when creating digital artwork, rather than using opacity.

# 3: Neutral colours ----

# Neutral palette
# 
# To accompany Nottingham Blue and the supporting palette,
# a small neutral palette can be used. This is made up of a light/warm grey and white.
# 
# These can be used on all designs where appropriate, and do not count towards the maximum two supporting colours per design and
# are permitted to make up over half of the designed asset, as these would be best used for text (white only) or backgrounds.
# 
# Portland Stone has a 40% tint available to create more accessible designs,
# more information on this can be found within the ‘digital backgrounds’ section.
# 
# Portland stone:
#  CMYK: 3, 3, 8, 0
#  RGB: R250, G246, B239
#  HEX: #FAF6EF
# 
#  40% tint: #FDFBF9
# 
# White:
# CMYK: 0, 0, 0, 0
# RGB: R255, G255, B255
# HEX: #FFFFFF

color_nottingham_3 <- c("#FAF6EF", "#FDFBF9", "#FFFFFF")
names_nottingham_3 <- c("Portland stone", "Portland stone 40", "white")


# 4: Digital backgrounds ----

# Digital backgrounds 
# 
# Using white as a background for digital applications can be difficult to read. You should instead use either a 5% tint of Nottingham Blue or a 40% tint of Portland Stone to create more accessible designs. 
# HEX codes can be found for these in the ‘neutral palette’ section and the ‘primary colour’ section.
