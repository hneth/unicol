# 3: Supportive palette / Key colours ---- 
# 
# Together with university and school brand colours, black and white with their grayscale tints are the key to a successful implementation of our design system.
# 
# As black and white not only perform well in any context or with any accent colour, they also possess the best visual contrast that makes them highly accessible as a pair. 
# 
# 
# Accessibility
# 
# Colour accessibility with white or black
# 
# This chart displays the brand colours of Aalto University and their accessibility when used together with black or white. The small dot represents sufficient contrast pair (either black or white) with the individual accent colour.
# 
# For sufficient contrast, there is a darker shade of purple to be used together with white type.
